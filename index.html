		<p id="content">An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are
			cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in
			Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for
			thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have
			religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian
			tradition.
      <br>
      <br>
			Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit
			frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto
			rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting.
			Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier
			harvesting.</p>

			<h1>Etymology</h1>
			<hr>
		</div>
		<div id="etymologycontent">
			<p id="etymologytext">The word apple, formerly spelled æppel in Old English, is derived from the Proto-Germanic
			root *ap(a)laz, which could also mean fruit in general. This is ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European
			*ab(e)l-, but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both words[clarification needed] is
			uncertain.
				<br><br>
			As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than berries but
			including nuts—such as the 14th century Middle English word appel of paradis, meaning a banana.[4] This use is
			analogous to the French language use of pomme.</p>

			<h1>Description</h1>
			<hr>
		</div>
		<div id="descriptioncontent">
			<p id="descriptiontext">The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15 ft) tall in
				cultivation and up to 9 m (30 ft) in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are
				determined by rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored
				simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.[5]
				<br><br>
				Apple blossom
				Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some
				long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1+1⁄2 in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five
				petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is
				called the "king bloom"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.[5][6]
				<br><br>
				The fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes.
				Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm (2+3⁄4 to 3+1⁄4 in) in diameter, due to market
				preference. Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below 5.5 cm (2+1⁄4
				in) are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally
				red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be found.[7] The skin may
				also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of
				epicuticular wax.[8] The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white,[7] though pink, yellow or green
				exocarps also occur.[9]</p>

				<h3>Wild Ancestors</h3>
					<p>The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus sieversii, found growing wild in the mountains of
						Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and northwestern China.[5][10] Cultivation of
						the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long
						period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated
						seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples
						being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In
						strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.[11][12][13]</p>

			<div id="genomepanel">
				<h3>Genome</h3>
				<p>Apple is diploid (though triploid cultivars are not uncommon), has 17 chromosomes and an estimated genome size of
					approximately 650 Mb. Several whole genome sequences have been made available, the first one in 2010 was based
					on the diploid cultivar 'Golden Delicious'.[14] However, this first whole genome sequence turned out to contain
					several errors[15] in part owing to the high degree of heterozygosity in diploid apples which, in combination
					with an ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly. Recently, double- and trihaploid individuals have
					been sequenced, yielding whole genome sequences of higher quality.[16][17] The first whole genome assembly was
					estimated to contain around 57,000 genes,[14] though the more recent genome sequences support more moderate
					estimates between 42,000 and 44,700 protein-coding genes.[16][17] Among other things, the availability of whole
					genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the cultivated apple most likely is Malus
					sieversii. Re-sequencing of multiple accessions has supported this, while also suggesting extensive
					introgression from Malus sylvestris following domestication.[18]</p>
